          <span><h2>About Deferred</h2>

<p>Sometimes I would like to include code in my project that is only available if certain libraries are loaded. Since I don't want to require these libraries as dependencies, but can't refer to their symbols either without them being loaded, things get a bit messy. This library attempts to provide a much more convenient way.</p>

<h2>How To</h2>

<p>Deferred uses two components: a dispatch reader macro on <code>#^</code> and a macro, <code><a href="#DEFERRED:WITH-DEFERRED-LIBRARY">WITH-DEFERRED-LIBRARY</a></code>. <code>#^</code> is used to circumvent the reader problem of being unable to refer to symbols in packages that don't exist at read-time. The macro is used to then acquire access to the symbol's environment to figure out the proper transformation for the symbol into an execution-time determined value.</p>

<pre><code>(<a href="#DEFERRED:WITH-DEFERRED-LIBRARY">with-deferred-library</a> (:drakma)
  (#^http-request &quot;http://google.com&quot;))</code></pre>

<p>Deferred symbols can be used in function calls, with <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a></code> and <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/QUOTE">QUOTE</a></code> and as values (f.e. special variables). Currently unsupported are deferred <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/SETF">SETF</a></code> functions as it's impossible to properly defer a <code><a href="http://l1sp.org/cl/SETF">SETF</a></code>-expander until execution-time.</p>

<p>If the default dispatch reader macro has been overwritten in your readtable for one reason or another, you can use <code>(named-readtables:in-readtable :deferred)</code>.</p>

                  </header>
                  <pre>Turns the body into one capable of using deferred symbols.

Specifying deferred symbols works just like other symbols, except prefixing them with #^ .
If the #^ reader macro has been overwritten in the standard readtable, please use
 (named-readtables:in-readtable :deferred)

ASDF-SYSTEM   --- An ASDF system designator.
PACKAGE       --- A package designator to use as the default package for deferred symbols.
IF-NOT-LOADED ::= NIL | :QUICKLOAD | :LOAD | :AUTO | T
                  NIL will simply skip executing the body if the library has not been loaded.
                  :LOAD will try to use ASDF:LOAD-SYSTEM and :QUICKLISP QL:QUICKLOAD.
                  :AUTO or T will try to do the right thing by checking for Quicklisp and ASDF
                  presence first. If neither can be found, an error is signalled. If the loading
                  operation fails, a warning is signalled and the body is NOT executed.

The only place I can think of that deferred symbols are currently not supported for is SETF
accessors. This is left out since there's no way to defer SETF-expanders to runtime.
You can still SETF symbol-values (special variables f.e.), but an error is signalled if
a deferred function is used within SETF.</pre>
